Liquidations refer to the automatic closure of leveraged positions when a trader's margin falls below the required maintenance level.

To prevent further losses, the exchange forcefully closes the position. These liquidation events often appear as trades on the order book, but they are not initiated by users â€” they are forced executions triggered by the system.

For example, a buy-side liquidation means a short position was forcibly closed by buying back the asset; a sell-side liquidation indicates a forced closure of a long position.

On the chart, Liquidations data is available as the "Liquidations" indicator in the "Financials" tab.

Values may be presented in base or quote currency, depending on the exchange and crypto derivative.

"Liquidations" is available for crypto derivatives of the following exchanges: BINANCE, BITMEX, BYBIT, DERIBIT, HTX, OKX.
