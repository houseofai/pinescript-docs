### plot.linestyle\_dashed

A named constant for use with the [plot](#fun_plot) function's `linestyle` parameter, which modifies the appearance of plotted lines. If the `style` argument of the function call specifies a plot style that displays a line, using this constant as the `linestyle` argument specifies that the plotted line is dashed.
