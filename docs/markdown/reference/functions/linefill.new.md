### linefill.new()

Creates a new linefill object and displays it on the chart, filling the space between `line1` and `line2` with the color specified in `color`.

Syntax

```
linefill.new(line1, line2, color) â†’ series linefill
```

Arguments

line1 (series line) First line object.

line2 (series line) Second line object.

color (series color) The color used to fill the space between the lines.

Returns

The ID of a linefill object that can be passed to other linefill.\*() functions.

Remarks

If any line of the two is deleted, the linefill object is also deleted. If the lines are moved (e.g. via [line.set\_xy](#fun_line.set_xy) functions), the linefill object is also moved.

If both lines are extended in the same direction relative to the lines themselves (e.g. both have [extend.right](#const_extend.right) as the value of their `extend=` parameter), the space between line extensions will also be filled.
