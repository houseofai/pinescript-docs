### ta.percentile\_nearest\_rank()

Calculates percentile using method of Nearest Rank.

Syntax

```
ta.percentile_nearest_rank(source, length, percentage) â†’ series float
```

Arguments

source (series int/float) Series of values to process (source).

length (series int) Number of bars back (length).

percentage (simple int/float) Percentage, a number from range 0..100.

Returns

P-th percentile of `source` series for `length` bars back.

Remarks

Using the Nearest Rank method on lengths less than 100 bars back can result in the same number being used for more than one percentile.

A percentile calculated using the Nearest Rank method will always be a member of the input data set.

The 100th percentile is defined to be the largest value in the input data set.

`na` values in the `source` series are ignored.
