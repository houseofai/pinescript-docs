### ta.correlation()

Correlation coefficient. Describes the degree to which two series tend to deviate from their [ta.sma](#fun_ta.sma) values.

```
ta.correlation(source1, source2, length) â†’ series float
```

Arguments

source1 (series int/float) Source series.

source2 (series int/float) Target series.
