### year()

Syntax

```
year(time, timezone) â†’ series int
```

Arguments

time (series int) UNIX time in milliseconds.

timezone (series string) Allows adjusting the returned value to a time zone specified in either UTC/GMT notation (e.g., "UTC-5", "GMT+0530") or as an IANA time zone database name (e.g., "America/New\_York"). Optional. The default is [syminfo.timezone](#var_syminfo.timezone).

Returns

Year (in exchange timezone) for provided UNIX time.

Remarks

UNIX time is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970.

Note that this function returns the year based on the time of the bar's open. For overnight sessions (e.g. EURUSD, where Monday session starts on Sunday, 17:00 UTC-4) this value can be lower by 1 than the year of the trading day.
